# Research Overview
I'm passionate about research at the intersections of Machine Learning, Natural and Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Biology and Medicine. For a complete list of my publications and patents, visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S6wyhngAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Here's a reverse-chronological summary of my work:

***

### Post-doc at Harvard Medical / Kempner Institute (current)
Working with [Kanaka Rajan](https://twitter.com/KanakaRajanPhD) at the intersection of DeepRL-Agents and Neuroscience. 

***

### Post-doc at Baylor College of Medicine/Rice University (2023)
Worked with [Ankit Patel](https://ankitlab.co) at the intersection of AI and Biology/Medicine
1. Understanding Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) evolvability through evolutionary simulations. See extended abstract ["Binding affinity distributions drive adaptation in GRN evolution"](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal/35/89/116839) at ALIFE 2023
2. Using (SOTA) LLMs to analyze Semi-Structured Healthcare interviews. (Nearing pre-print stage) 
3. Characterizing the evolution of molecular markers of [Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)](https://www.mds-foundation.org/what-is-mds/) in multi-omic liquid biopsies. (In progress) 

***

### Post-PhD Industry (2022)
Research Scientist in Machine Learning in the [Probability team](https://research.facebook.com/teams/probability/) team at Meta. Worked on team proojects involving: 
* Uncertainty Quantification using Neural Networks (Deep Ensembles, MCMCDropout, ...)
* Bayesian Modeling for Online Experiments (primarily using sampling-based inference from the in-house [Bean Machine](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2021/12/introducing-bean-machine-a-probabilistic-programming-platform-built-on-pytorch/) PPL) 

<!-- At the end of a [very volatile year](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/technology/meta-layoffs-facebook.html), my entire org was [disbanded](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-layoffs-hit-entire-ml-research-team-focused-on-infrastructure/) in Nov 2022. While I had the option to stick around and find another team after the layoffs, I decided to pursue my research passions. -->

### PhD (9/2017 - 12/2021)
* PhD at the [University of Washington (Seattle)](https://www.washington.edu), at the intersection of ML/RL and Computational Neuroscience. Advised by [Bingni W Brunton (UW Neurobiology)](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/bing-w-brunton) and [Rajesh PN Rao (UW Computer Science)](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/rao).
