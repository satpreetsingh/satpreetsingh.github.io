**UPDATE**: I am on the academic job market for positions that start in Fall 2025.  

Welcome to my homepage!  
I am currently a postdoc with [Kanaka Rajan](https://twitter.com/KanakaRajanPhD) at the [Harvard Medical School](https://neuro.hms.harvard.edu) and the [Kempner Institute](https://www.harvard.edu/kempner-institute/).  

Previously, I spent a year applying AI to Biology and Medicine at [Ankit Patel](https://ankitlab.co)'s lab at [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu)/[Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) (Houston, TX), and another as a Research Scientist in Machine Learning at Meta's [Probability](https://research.facebook.com/teams/probability/) team.  

I graduated with a PhD in Dec 2021 from the [University of Washington (Seattle)](https://www.ece.uw.edu), with research at the intersection of Machine/Reinforcement Learning and Computational Neuroscience. Prior to this, I earned an MS in Computer Science at [Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu) and an MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the [University of Iowa](https://ece.engineering.uiowa.edu).  

I have worked in industry for ~5 years:  
- Research Scientist in Machine Learning at Meta  
- Data Scientist on the [LinkedIn.com Data Science team](https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data) (now Microsoft)  
- ML/Data Engineer and Product Manager at [Orbitz.com (now Expedia)](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/orbitz-labs/)
